## What is?
3-tier Web Application (MVC), deployed in the cloud (PaaS) using Oracle Cloud and agile approach methodology (SCRUM).

## Objectives and Utilities.
This application seeks to understand the software life cycle, including the stage of use.
It seeks to understand the languages ​​and protocols used in a WEB application, such as html, xml, http, CSS, Java, etc.
Basic security mechanisms of a WEB application are applied, through authentication through OAuth2.
The concept of API REST is disclosed, to decouple the Front or Back of a WEB app.
Relational database (MySQL) is used as part of the WEB application.

## Tools, clouds, languages, frameworks and utilities used:

  Jira, as project manager within the framework of the agile approach methodology.
  Oracle Cloud, as a server in the cloud where the use is made.
  Java, JavaSript, HTML and CSS, as languages ​​(and markup language) for the creation of the Back and Front.
  Ajax calls (JQuery), as a facility to make requests within JavaScript.

  OAuth2 as an authentication tool through GitHub.
  MySql as a relational database, stored on the Oracle Cloud virtual server.
  Spring, as the main framework that allows flexibility and modularity in the project.
  Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA and Spring Security, to develop self-contained applications, initial dependency management, interaction with the entities of
  the database, management of annotations (@Entity, @Table, @Column, etc), optimization of repetitive tasks through JDBC, use of repositories without code with
  JPARepository, CrudRepository, etc.
  
  Configuration of the project standardized by Apache Maven V3.6.1.
